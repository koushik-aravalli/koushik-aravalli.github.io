        <p>Awesome!!! Here you are to know a little bit about me. Its been almost 8 years now that I have lived in the Netherlands with my wife and 3 years old. My roots are from south indian city, Hyderabad (another mini-IT hub). 
          I believe and noticed that living by profession can be achieved when we start changing our approach at work rather than searching interest in a new field.

          <i>My background</i> I started learning programming not to achive anything but spend time with my sister before she left for her higher education. 
          Basic program training on C and C++ and running the "HelloWorld" on that UNIX kernel box made me feel like I can create the whole world infact. That motivated me to continue further.

          Learning is fun and it never ends, with continous evolution of IT (software/middleware/hardware) keeping up with the blog posts updates or refinements will keep me closer to my laptop.
          So, this blog is going to be a journey for me that focuses, highlights the aspects that I encounter. With the inspiration of industry experts and motivation from my collegues but surely will do my best to share experiences.
