### PODS

Pod is a smallest component in the K8S architecture. A container typically has one-one relation with a Pod. For scenarios where application needs pattern implementation like sidecar or adaptor or even ambassador. 

#### YAML for PODS

K8S YAML has 4 root levels required fields: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`

`apiVersion` : ApiVersion of K8S (v1 &rarr; all `1.xx` versions, including alpha and beta)

`kind` : Type of object (Pods, Service, ReplicaSet, Deployment)

`metadata` : A Dictionary of the object like `name` (string value), `labels` (Dictionary value, any non k8s specific unlike the root level metadata)

`spec`: Depending on type of object, the information changes. This is also a dictionary.

Sample

```
# nginx-pod-definition.yaml

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
    name: sample-app
    labels:
        app: api
        type: frontend

spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx

```

To create the container with the above file use:

```
kubectl create -f ./nginx-pod-definition.yaml
```

#### Debugging

- If the YAML is malformed, kubectl errors outs during execution. 

- If the `image` provided in the definition `spec` is not found, `kubectl get pods` still returns the described pod but with state `Imagepullbackoff`. 

- To see the details of a pod use the following

    ```
    # get all details
    kubectl describe pod <podname> | grep

    # get information without full details
    kubectl get pods <podname> -o wide
    ```

    - Events: list of actions performed in sequence
    - Node

- To extract pod definition yaml for an existing pod:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > <pod-definition-file-name.yaml>
    ```

- To apply changes to a running pod, 

    ```
    # get current running config and once updated and save it is directly applied

    kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
    ```
