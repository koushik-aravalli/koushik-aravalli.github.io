### PODS

Pod is a smallest component in the K8S architecture. A container typically has one-one relation with a Pod. For scenarios where application needs pattern implementation like sidecar or adaptor or even ambassador. 

#### YAML for PODS

K8S YAML has 4 root levels required fields: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`

`apiVersion` : ApiVersion of K8S (v1 &rarr; all `1.xx` versions, including alpha and beta)

`kind` : Type of object (Pods, Service, ReplicaSet, Deployment)

`metadata` : A Dictionary of the object like `name` (string value), `labels` (Dictionary value, any non k8s specific unlike the root level metadata)

`spec`: Depending on type of object, the information changes. This is also a dictionary.

##### POD definition - vanilla flavour

```
# nginx-pod-definition.yaml

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
    name: sample-app
    labels:
        app: api
        type: frontend

spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx

```

##### POD definition file with Arguments

Most of the container images built have docker file with `ENTRYPOINT` (which command to execute on startup of the container) and `CMD` (what are the input arguments to be passed). When creating a POD definition to deploy such a container and overwrite the default values defined in the `dockerfile`, include under the containers section `command` and `args`. ***Note that `args` accepts array of values.***

```
# tomcat-pod-definition.yaml

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
    name: sample-app-2
    labels:
        app: api-2
        type: frontend

spec:
    containers:
        - name: tomcat-container
          image: tomcat
          command: '/usr/local/tomcat/entrypoint.sh'
          args: ["8080"]
```

##### Create POD in K8S

To create the container with the above file use:

```
kubectl create -f ./nginx-pod-definition.yaml
```

##### Security on POD

K8S provides capabilities to add security at either POD level or at the container level. By adding SecurityContext Object with runAsUser along with required capabilities is a way forward to provide fine grained access to the users. Following is a sample POD definition:

```
# nginx-pod-definition.yaml

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
    name: sample-app
    labels:
        app: api
        type: frontend

spec:
    # POD level security
    # Add user who has ID 1000
    securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000

    containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
          # Container level security
          # Add user who has ID 2000, and restricted capabilties to only manage system date
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 2000
            capablities:
                add: ["SYS_DATE"]

```



#### Debugging

- If the YAML is malformed, kubectl errors outs during execution. 

- If the `image` provided in the definition `spec` is not found, `kubectl get pods` still returns the described pod but with state `Imagepullbackoff`. 

- To see the details of a pod use the following

    ```
    # get all details
    kubectl describe pod <podname> | grep

    # get information without full details
    kubectl get pods <podname> -o wide
    ```

    - Events: list of actions performed in sequence
    - Node

- To extract pod definition yaml for an existing pod:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > <pod-definition-file-name.yaml>

    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o wide # all details of pod
    ```

- To apply changes to a running pod, 

    ```
    # get current running config and once updated and save it is directly applied

    kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
    ```

- To search for the PODs based on their labels:

    ```
    kubectl get pod -l <name-of-lable>=<value-of-label>
    ```

- To dive into the running pod, similar to Docker

    ```
    kubectl exec -it <name-of-pod> -- <command>
    kubectl exec -it ubuntu-sleeper -- date -s 'Apr 27 2021, 07:00:00'
    ```

#### Gottcha

- Want to overwrite the container `entrypoint` on running container in the POD, no cannot. To do so, delete the POD and recreate it. **Use the deployment YAML which automatically takes care if it**
