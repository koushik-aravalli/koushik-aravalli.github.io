Hi and welcome to my blog. I am Koushik, working as a Software engineer for over 15 years. You can get in touch with me from my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koushik-aravalli/). 

If you are still reading .. then this is my frame of thought

Imagine there is no google or any other search engines, would we have cornered that investigation which we picked? Would we have crossed so many of our challenges? 
It is the community who helps and those brilliant ideas (always relative!!) that break through to solve our equations. 
I believe through continuous learning and experience, that femto amps of spark lit to our brilliant ideas. so learn-implement-act-repeat that is what I do. 

***By the way, all ideas, thoughts, scribbles, scratches, code snippets, pushes mentioned here are my own not influenced by anyone nor reflections of my employer.***

_It is within the moments of a decision making that carves persons destiny._
